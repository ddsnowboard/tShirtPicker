tShirtPicker
============

A python application into which you put in your collection of t-shirts and 
it tells you which one to wear each day, based on which one you've worn least recently. Soon it will have a GUI, but it doesn't yet. The command line version should be working though, which is good. And if you should download this, you might want to delete the database I have in this git, they're my t-shirts. It should work and just create a new one if it's deleted, but I now know it doesn't. Maybe I should fix that... 
Hey, I fixed it! Anyway, soon here, I'm going to start on the GUI, with Tkinter.
